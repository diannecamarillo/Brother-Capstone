 1. Deliverables Accomplished
I added a View controllers that send the user to forms to add events to schedule, take notes, and set alarms.
 Assets were added and the user can now switch between all View Controllers.
 
 2. Deliverables missed
 I missed adding spotify and displaying weather. I downloaded the SDK for Spotify but have not gotten it to work yet.
 
 3. Challenges faced since last report
 I am still having trouble implementing the Spotify SDK. I am still looking into how to use Core Data in Swift as it was recently changed in the new version of Swift. I am looking into how to make a Persistence class for data to save to.
 
 4. Challenges resolved since last report
 I found an easy way for the user to switch between all available View Controllers. I also found out how to make a form with input text fields for the user to fill.
 
 5. Strategy for solving new challenges.
 I am going to look deeper into the apple developer website with tutorials along with the swift docuemntation to better understand how Core Data is used. I will also look more into the Spotify Developer website to see how the SDK can be implemented.
 
 6. Resources needed.
 I will need an Apple Developer Account to make the app downloadable.
 
 7. To-Do-List for the next report.
 For the next report, I will have the Spotify SDK correctly implemented and linked to the users alarms. The weather will also be displayed on the daily schedule tab. The inputs from the forms will also be saved and displayed on a list in the daily schedule.
 
 8. Software artifact new functionalities added
 The basic layout of the app is now fully browsable for the user. Before, all the tabs were created but not linked, but by adding a tabView, the user can now see all View controllers and easily switch between them. Then for the calendar, notes, and alarms, there is a form for the user to fill out to add an event, note, or set an alarm. Before, there was just a button with a menu to add or delete something. Now, the button can lead to another page displaying a form. Assets for the app were also added, in the first screen displayed when launching the app, there is the name (Brother) displayed, and the notes page has an asset of a notebook. Then the daily schedule View was created and there is a basic structure of all the things that Brother will display to the user.
